#           FILE:  sysctl_boilerplate.conf
#          USAGE:  edit parameters and put them into /etc/sysctl.conf
#
#    DESCRIPTION:  This is a boilerplate of /etc/sysctl.conf kernel config file
#                  adopted for server using with any modern Linux distribution.
#                  This file contains some basic tweaks for a different kernel
#                  parameters which can increase performance, responsiveness
#                  and network throughput in the high-load scenario for web
#                  server, streaming or storage server, e.t.c.
#
#   REQUIREMENTS:  /dev/brain, /dev/hands
#          NOTES:  YOU MUST ADJUST ALL THESE PARAMETERS FOR YOUR SITUATION!
#                  Also do not change the value of any kernel parameter on a
#                  system where it is already set higher than listed as minimum
#                  requirement in this boilerplate.
